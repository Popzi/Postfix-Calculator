# Postfix Calculator

This was written in the course Algorithms and Softwaredesign.
The task was to implement an abstract datatype for Stack and implement calculator operations. The datastructure for the abstract datatype had to consist of linked nodes.

The calculator had to accept postfix notation strings. ![Read more about Postfix strings here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Files that were mainly made by me are: NodeStack.cs, Program.cs and all operators in the Operations folder.

I must warn that this script is not the best example of following standard naming conventions but I will blame it on being a student and not knowing better :-)
